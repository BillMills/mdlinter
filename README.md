Custom linter for docker training exercises. Currently checks for:

 - newline at the end of all exercises
 - two spaces after single digit step numerals (ie one-dot-space-space, not just single space)
 - 4 space indents
 - no double blank lines inside code blocks
 - code blocks should be surrounded by a blank line before and after
 - code block lines <= 90 char
